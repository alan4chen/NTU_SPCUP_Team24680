Embedded system:
	*	Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
		(Please see "raspberrypi3b.jpg")

Accessary:
	*	a USB Microphone on "plughw:1,0"
		(card 1: Device [USB PnP Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio])
	*	a RGB LED on GPIO
		(R:22, G:27, B:17)

How to Run:
	0.  Compile Aubio that we submitted:
		[./aubio]$ ./waf configure
		[./aubio]$ ./waf build
		[./aubio]$ sudo ./waf install

	1.  Clean bin files:
		[./source]$ sudo make clean
		
	2.	Compile the program and Init the LED0 and the RGB-LED:
		[./source]$ sudo make flow

	3.	Run the program
		[./source]$ sudo make run

		(the program would detect the sound 30 seconds. 
		You could press CTRL+C to kill the program afterwards.)


Thanks!
